# Redesign

ok, we will create some layout propositions now to make the site fit better the purpose.

## Purpose

The site is a personal site of Adam Kucharczyk (me). We are currently designing the main/landing page.

Its main purpose is to promote me as an experienced, 20+ years of experience senior IT architect offering

1. lessons/courses on advanced AI topics like "application and solutions architecture for senior developers in AI era"
2. direct consulting for business on IT architecture and AI

I like dimmed, pastel palette close to Solarized color schema, at least with first approach. Still typographic contrast is valuated.
